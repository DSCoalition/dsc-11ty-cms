        <h3 class="text-gray">We’re a collection of agile technology and design firms that serve—or aspire to serve—the government.</h3>
        <p>Change is hard. Systematic change is even harder. That’s why these design and development firms have teamed up to bring the innovation and agility that’s become the backbone of commercial digital services to the government.</p>
        <p>This kind of digital transformation uses technology as a means to a goal—to dramatically improve the performance, reach, and customer experience of government services.</p>

        <p>True digital transformation within the government has meaningful, tangible benefits for the public.</p>
        <p>It means that the hundreds of millions of people who interact with our government could do so easily, efficiently, and dare we say, even enthusiastically through their phones, tablets, and computers.
        </p>
        <p>It means that analog, paper-based processes are modernized into integrated, online workflows to speed up how the government works and save taxpayer dollars.
        </p>
        <p>It means that technology infrastructure becomes more scalable, flexible, and secure, allowing services to work faster and more reliably.</p>

      <h1 class="text-blue pt-4">Stronger together.</h1>
      <p>The current “big box” contractor model is failing to deliver the kinds of collaboration, transparency, and efficiency that smaller, more forward-thinking firms excel at. Our goal is to collaborate, not compete by bringing like-minded small to midsize companies together to work toward the common mission of serving the American public by improving how government works.</p>
      <h3 class="text-gray mt-5">Our manifesto to do just that.</h3>
