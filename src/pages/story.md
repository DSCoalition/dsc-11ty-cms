**The Digital Services Coalition (DSC) is a 501(c)(6) trade association dedicated to advancing digital services in government by fostering collaboration between the public sector and the private market.**  <br><br>

Originally formed in 2017 as the Agile Contracting Community of Practice, DSC was established in 2019 to share best practices, address common challenges, and improve government adoption of modern technology solutions. <br><br>

Today, DSC supports, educates, and represents its member companies, ensuring they have the resources and strategic guidance needed to drive meaningful change. More than just a trade group, DSC is committed to common values and high-quality delivery to promote better outcomes through more effective, user-centered government services. <br><br>
