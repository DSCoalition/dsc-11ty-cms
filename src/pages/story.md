It started with the Digital Services Playbook, which outlines 13 key “plays” to help the government build more successful digital services. Robert Rasmussen, the CEO of Agile Six, saw this as an opportunity to improve how government contractors could deliver these services by nurturing a sense of community, rather than rivalry.</br>
He approached other like-minded companies to create the Digital Services Coalition as a place to share knowledge, find teaming partners for government proposals, and mentor firms who want to get involved in rethinking how the government delivers digital services. By creating this community, we can all bring our best talents to the table and learn from each other’s successes and failures.
