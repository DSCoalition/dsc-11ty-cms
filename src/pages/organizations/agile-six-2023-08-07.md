organizationName: Agile Six
organizationDescription: “We believe that strong teams are built on trust and
  agility. When someone tells you that they’ve “Got Your Six,” it means they’re
  watching your back. Knowing other member firms have our six means we can focus
  on transforming the working relationship between government and the private
  sector — which we believe will deliver better digital experiences for our
  citizens.”
